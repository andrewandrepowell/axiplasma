# Plasma AXI-based System-on-Chip 

The **Plasma AXI-based System-on-Chip (Plasma-SoC)** is an extension of *Steve Rhoads' Plasma MLite Core*, a processor that implements MIPS I with a small subset of Coprocessor 0 in order to provide limited support for interrupts and system calls. As its name implies, the cores of the Plasma-SoC relies on *ARM AMBA4 Advanced eXtensible Interfaces (AXI)* for communication over a configurable AXI4-Full Crossbar Interconnect.

At this time, the major components of the Plasma-SoC consist of a *CPU*, *Timer*, *Interrupt Controller*, *GPIO*, *UART*, and *Interconnect*.
