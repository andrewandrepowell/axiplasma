# Plasma AXI-based System-on-Chip 

The **Plasma AXI-based System-on-Chip (Plasma-SoC)** is an extension of *[Steve Rhoads' Plasma MLite Core](https://opencores.org/project,plasma)*, a processor that implements MIPS I with a small subset of Coprocessor 0 in order to provide limited support for interrupts and system calls. As its name implies, the cores of the Plasma-SoC relies on *ARM AMBA4 Advanced eXtensible Interfaces (AXI)* for communication over a configurable AXI4-Full Crossbar Interconnect.

The major hardware components of the Plasma-SoC consist of a *CPU*, *Timer*, *Interrupt Controller*, *GPIO*, *UART*, *Interconnect*, and an example design created to run on the Digilent Nexys4 board. The software includes *hardware drivers*, *FreeRTOS port*, *ICSP bootloader*, *Threadmetric Benchmark port*, and several other examples to test and demonstrate the hardware's functionality. There are also several utility programs not intended to run on the hardware.

## Getting Started

### File Structure

Take note of the Plasma-SoC's file structure shown below. For the sake of brevity, many of the sources are omitted from the structure. However, understand that the files not shown are still needed. Please see the sources themselves for more information.

+ hdl --- All the VHDL hardware sources. 
   + plasma --- Steve Rhoads' Plasma MLite Core.
   + plasoc --- Plasma-SoC cores, such as peripherals and interconnect. 
   + projects --- RTL examples.
      + Nexys4 --- Project developed specifically for the Digilent Nexys4 Artix-7 board.
+ mips --- All the C/MIPs sources, including applications, drivers, and operating system.
   + apps --- Application that can run on the Plasma-SoC.
      + bootloader_app --- Currently supports loading an application into memory with in-circuit serial programming (ICSP).
      + cache_app --- Tests the operations of the CPU's L1 cache.
      + freertos_app --- Runs a FreeRTOS example.
      + threadmetric_apps --- Contains several applications needed to generate benchmarks for the Plasma-SoC FreeRTOS port with ThreadMetric.
      + timer\_interrupt\_app --- Tests the Time Core. 
      + uart_app --- Tests the UART Core.
   + freertos --- FreeRTOS port for the Plasma-SoC.
   + plasma --- Sources related to Steve Rhoads' Plasma MLite Core. Note that boot source was modified for the purposes of the Plasma-SoC.
   + plasoc --- Sources needed for the Plasma-SoC. The drivers for the peripherals are located under this directory.
+ misc --- All the utility programs.
   + bin2coe.py --- A command line program that generates either a COE file or a custom VHDL source that contains the HEX of a binary.
   + gencross.py --- A command line program that generates the wrapper for the crossbar interconnect.
   + icsp.py --- A command line program that loads a binary to the Plasma-SoC provided that the Plasma-SoC is running the bootloader.

### Prerequisites

+ Cross compilation tools --- A GCC MIPS cross compiler and bin utilities are necessary to build binary. It is recommended to run this [Makefile that downloads and builds the MIPS compiler and bin utilities](https://github.com/ktbarrett/gcc-cross). The Makefile has been tested on Ubuntu and Windows with Msys2. Alternatively, compilation and build tools can be immediately downloaded from [uClib's download page](https://www.uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/0.9.30.1/), although these only work on Linux and are not fully updated.
+ EDA --- The project located under "hdl/projects/Nexys4" is generated with Vivado. All of the testing up to this point has also been done with Xilinx's Vivado Design Suite IDE. However, the Plasma-SoC is developed for portability; it should run with any EDA or configurable logic development tools. It should be noted the version of Vivado used for development was [2016.4](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).
+ Python2.7 --- In order to run the utility programs, a Python2.7 interpreter is needed. It is recommended to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
+ PySerial --- The icsp.py command line utility program requires the [PySerial module](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) in order to operate.
+ Serial Console --- In order to view messages from the UART Core, the host computer needs a serial console. The protocol is 9600 Baud 8N1. For Ubuntu, Minicom should already be installed. On Windows, [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) is recommended.

### Installing

#### Hardware

Applying the Plasma-SoC consists of setting up the RTL project with a selected EDA, compiling a binary for the hardware to execute, and deployment. These steps don't necessarily have to be completed in the order given.

All RTL development and testing so far been completed in Vivado 2016.4 IDE for the Digilent Nexys4 board. With the IDE, a project can be generated by the following steps.

1. Start Vivado IDE.
2. In the TCL command line, use the "cd" command to change the directory to "/hdl/projects/Nexys4".
3. Under the tools menu, use "Run TCL script.." to run the create_project.tcl script located in "/hdl/projects/Nexys4".

At this point, the simulator can be started to demonstrate an application and compilation can be started to generate a bit file that already has the bootloader loaded into BRAM. More documentation can be found in the sources themselves.

#### Software

The applications located in the "mips/apps" and "hdl/projects/Nexys4" directories all depend on Makefiles in order to perform certain operations.
